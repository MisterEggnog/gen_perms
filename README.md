# Read Me
This program prints all permutations of a string.
## How to use
Pass a string to get all permutations.

This will generate n! / m1!m2!...mn! permutations
Where n is the length of the string & mx is the number of times that number repeats.
For example, the word `tree` would have 4!/2!, (simplifying the 1! operations)
This can get large quickly.
